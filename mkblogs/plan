1. This gonna taking time, we need merge build_pages with build, coz now they
are same.

We don't distinguish build_pages with build_blogs anymore.
Pages don't have private directory anymore. After we are sure all the pages
exist, we just recursively build it.

Now this is how build() works:

1. recursive scan the directory and tries to build all the pages.
2. Just write htmls right in current directories.
3. Now we build pages, because index.md and catalist.md are also in pages, so we
can compile them along with others.

3. Afterwards, copy all the media files to site_directory.

DONE:
+. modify config, add 'docs_dir' as prefix to pages
+. reuse site_navigation, creating one is really painfull
+. read _generate_site_navigation and path_to_url, now we decided not to use
   separate directory for every page, there must be something we need to fix.


TODO: 
+. Problems occur when generate nav_items, find problem with it.

+. generate write index.md whenever we need to update blogs.

+. use python native src file as conf format, use importlib.import_module to
   import it.

+. do not generate index.md if no needs
