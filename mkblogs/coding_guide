Mkdocs works in this way:

when you invoke it, it always build a config first, then use other command to
build the site or something. Okay, We only care about build.

build command workflow:

1) we always stay on where you invoke the command.
2) The abs path starts at site/, where index.html located
3) build function copies everything except mkdown files to from 'docs' to 'site'
4) _build_page is responsible for reading markdown files from 'docs' and write
   to 'site', it use path.join() to handle it.

copy docs, themes to site.
